<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <strong>Contact App</strong> is a simple and efficient contact management system that allows users to <strong>store, view, and delete contact data</strong>. This app integrates with <strong>ThunderClient</strong> for seamless API requests and provides a user-friendly UI to manage contacts effectively.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Add Contacts:</strong> Store contact details such as name, email, and phone number using ThunderClient.</li>
    <li><strong>View Contacts:</strong> Display all stored contacts in a well-structured UI.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete Contacts:</strong> Remove any contact easily from the UI with a delete option.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<h3>Adding a Contact</h3>
<p>Use ThunderClient to send a <strong>POST request</strong> to the backend API with contact details. The backend saves the data in the database and returns a response.</p>

<h3>Viewing Contacts</h3>
<p>The frontend fetches stored contacts from the backend using a <strong>GET request</strong>. Contacts are displayed in a list format with essential details.</p>

<h3>Deleting a Contact</h3>
<p>Users can click on the <strong>delete button</strong> next to a contact. A <strong>DELETE request</strong> is sent to the backend, and the contact is removed from the database. The UI updates dynamically to reflect the changes.</p>
